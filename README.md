EIA-Oil-Gas-Maps
================

Just a dump of all the geospatial data on the [EIA Oil and Gas Field website](http://www.eia.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/analysis_publications/maps/maps.htm)

Includes things like gas field boundaries, oil field boundaries and coal belts.

Converted all the shapefiles to geoJSON for easy viewing on GitHub.
